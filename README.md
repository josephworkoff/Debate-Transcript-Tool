Democratic Primary Debate Transcript Analysis Tool

This application uses the data set found here: https://www.kaggle.com/brandenciranni/democratic-debate-transcripts-2020.<br>
The dataset was slightly modified. Dates were changed from MM-DD-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format. <br>
    Some event names change to more appropriate titles, e.g. South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate to South Carolina Democratic Debate.<br>

This dataset contains the transcripts from each Democratic Primary debate from June 2019 to February 2020, broken up by each individual speech and encoded in CSV format. 
Each datum includes the date of the event, the event name, the section of the debate, the speaker's name, the words spoken, and the speech duration.

This program reads the transcript data into data structures, then present the user options to sort and view them based on several metrics.
